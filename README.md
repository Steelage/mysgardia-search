# mysgardia-search
The Sanctuary takes too long list of creatures, and the Manage Creatures is screwed up yet; here this exists for easily browsing Mysgardia Creatures in the Sanctuary(profile page)!

# The things I want to note down
There is nothing so much to be noted about the code itself, but there are a couple of hidden facts about it:
1. **the NAME input is regExp-based**, you may filter those with default names by inserting <code>^(?!Amoura)</code> and such.
2. If a special form is given to CLICKS input, it will only show those within the range. **Inserting like 123-456 to get the range filter.**
3. **It will work well in the latest version of Firefox/Chrome browser.**
